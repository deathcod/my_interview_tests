1. Parse the text and find out separate poems/plays and store them in mongodb.

2. Process the texts to find different entities (Person, Place at the least). Build an API to serve this information, i.e. given an entity name, it should return the work's name.

3. Find out relationships between these entities. Build an API to serve this information, i.e. if asked 

relationship_between("Antonio", "Bassanio")
